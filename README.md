# surfs_up
Bootcamp Module 9

### Overview
We want to create a query, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop is sustainable year-round. We created a code that retrieves information from our database in order to see the two extremes of the year. We will see the historical data from the months of June and December. With this data, we plan to discover if we can sustain the business year-round.

### Results: 
Here are the mains results of our query. First we can see the data for the weather in June. In the next table, we can analyze the data for December.

With these dataframes we can conclude the following:
- The average temperature for June is 74.94º while the average temperature for December is 71.04º. Which means there is 3.9º degree difference, which means December is 5.20% colder than June.
- The maximum temperature for June is 85º while the average temperature for December is 83º. Which means there is 2º degree difference, which means the highest temperature in December is 2.35% colder than the highest temperature in June.
- The minimum temperature for June is 64º while the average temperature for December is 56º. Which means there is 8º degree difference, which means the lowest temperature in December is 12.5% colder than the lowest temperature in June.

### Summary: 
As we can see in the results of our data, there is not much difference between the months of June and December. We can see by the average temperature, that June (74.94º) is a little over 3 degrees hotter than December (71.04º), which is not much, compared with other destinations. Also we can see the maximun temperature for June is only 2 degrees hotter (85º) than de maximum temperature for December (83º). While the gap is a little wider between the minimum temperature in December (56º) and June (64º), there is still pretty good average temperature for ice cream and surf year-wide.

Other than the temperature, I decided to run a query on precipitation, to see if rain affected different the month of June and December. Here are the tables. The former is June, the latter is December.

With this tables we can observe that the average precipitation is higher in December (0.2168) than in June (0.1363), which menas June has 37.12% less precipitation compared to December. This is something we might take in consideration in our business plan.
